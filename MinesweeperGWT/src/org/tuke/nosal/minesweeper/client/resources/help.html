<h2>Help for the Minesweeper Game</h2>
This document explains how to play the minesweeper game.

<h3>Controls</h3>
The game is controlled by left and right mouse buttons. Use left button to open a tile and right button to mark/unmark a tile that you think contains mine. Marked tiles are secured for accidental opening.

<h3>Game Goal</h3>
Your goal in the game is to find all mines. Game is won when all the tiles that do <b>not</b> contain mines are open. To deduce where are the mines tiles contain clues. Each no-mine tile has a numerical clue, a number of adjacent mines.

<h3>Game Interface</h3>
The main part of the user interface is the game field with tiles. At the top of it are two labels. The left one shows the number of remaining unmarked mines. The right one counts the time from the start of the game.
